# Disable Gatekeeper on macOS Big Sur (11.x)

## Why?

Since macOS 10.8, Apple requires applications to be signed before they can be
run. However, code signing is a paid process (costing a $99/year subscription,
and more if you also want to publish to the Mac App Store).

Independent developers may not have the time or budget required to sign their
applications or upload them to the Mac App Store. Due to this, many open source
applications can't be run out of the box on macOS.

Recent macOS versions have made it increasingly difficult to disable Gatekeeper.
Thankfully, there are still several ways to disable or bypass it as of March 2021.

## Usage

### Disabling Gatekeeper permanently

1. Open a terminal by pressing <kbd>Cmd + Space</kbd>, enter "Terminal" and open
   the application.
2. Run the following command: `sudo spctl --master-disable`.
   Enter your administrator password when requested.
3. Gatekeeper is now disabled permanently.

### Disabling Gatekeeper for one application only

#### Using Finder

**Note:** This method may not work for all applications. If the application
still doesn't run after following the steps below, try following the steps
described in **Using Terminal** instead.

1. Open Finder and navigate to the application you just downloaded.
2. Right-click the application and choose **Open**.
3. Click **Cancel** in the confirmation dialog that appears. This is required
   since macOS Big Sur, as the dialog must now be opened twice for the **Open**
   button to appear. On macOS Catalina and older, you only have to open this
   dialog once.
4. Right-click the application *a second time* and choose **Open** again.
5. Click **Open** in the confirmation dialog that appears.

You only have to do this for the first application start.
You can start the application as usual afterwards.

#### Using Terminal

1. Open a terminal by pressing <kbd>Cmd + Space</kbd>, enter "Terminal" and open
   the application.
2. Run the following command: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Application.app`.
   The path is case-sensitive and must point to the application bundle.
   (You can use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to complete file paths.)

You only have to do this before starting the application for the first time.
You can start the application as usual afterwards.

#### Using curl or wget

You can also download the application using a tool that doesn't set the
quarantine attribute. `curl` or `wget` should work for this. Open a terminal
then run:

```bash
# Quoting the URL is recommended to avoid issues with special characters.
curl -LO "file URL"

# Or, if you have installed wget:
wget "file URL"
```

This is how Steam and update frameworks like Sparkle are able to download
and run applications without requiring them to be signed.

## Frequently asked questions

### Isn't it insecure to disable Gatekeeper?

With today's security threats, antivirus software is becoming less relevant over
the years. Many antiviruses are now fooled by malware executables, and other
forms of malware aren't detected by most antiviruses. While perfect security
doesn't exist, it still is a good idea to avoid exposing yourself to modern
threats such as ransomware.

To make your computing more secure, consider the following options:

- Block tracking and malware scripts using
  [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock).
  This will also make browsing faster and decrease network traffic.
- Block tracking and malware domains using
  [Dan Pollock's `hosts` file](http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/zero/).
  This has the upside of working on all software on your computer,
  not just Web browsers.

### I still can't run an application after disabling Gatekeeper.

If the application was packaged in a ZIP archive, this could be due to the
executable (`+x`) attribute being missing on the binary contained in the .app
bundle. To solve this:

1. Open a terminal by pressing <kbd>Cmd + Space</kbd>, enter "Terminal" and open
   the application.
2. Run the following command: `chmod +x /path/to/Application.app/Contents/MacOS/*`.
   The path is case-sensitive and must point to the application bundle.
   (You can use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to complete file paths.)

You only have to do this before starting the application for the first time.
You can start the application as usual afterwards.
